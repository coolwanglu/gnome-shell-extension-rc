This extension allows you to add handy stuffs in ~/.gnomeshellrc.js

###Why

GNOME-Shell is powerful for its extension system, for example you can easily remove the a11y icon by installing an extension.

Sweet!...but wait, isn't it weird that you have to install an extension for this one-liner job (see the example)? 

If I were the author of the extension, I don't think I would enjoy writing the `init/enable/disable` interface, applying the license and waiting for approval.
 
I've got 100+ lines in my `~/.vimrc`, and I can modify them, enable/disable them or change the order in seconds. How about extensions? 

Consider this ironic *one-liner* extension as your `~/.vimrc` for GNOME-Shell. Or maybe Stylish or Greasemonkey without repository. But speaking of repository, maybe the `snippets.js` file can be utilized?

See `snippets.js` for useful snippets.

Happy hacking!
